# ARM-UNICEF Disaster Vulnerability Challenge Solution

This repository contains my solution for the [ARM-UNICEF Disaster Vulnerability Challenge](https://zindi.africa/competitions/arm-unicef-disaster-vulnerability-challenge) hosted on Zindi.

## Repository Structure

- **data/**: Contains the data used for training and testing models.
- **src/**: Source code and scripts for the solution.
- **SampleSubmission.csv**: Example submission file provided by the competition.
- **eda.ipynb**: Exploratory Data Analysis notebook.
- **inference.ipynb**: Notebook used for generating predictions with custom losses.
- **jupyter.sh**: Script for running Jupyter notebooks, particularly for Faster R-CNN training.
- **launch.sh**: Script to launch the training pipeline, focusing on Faster R-CNN.
- **starting-notebook-for-arm-unicef-disaster-vulnerability.ipynb**: The initial notebook with DETR base model setup.
- **submission.csv**: Final submission file with predictions.
- **train.py**: Python script for training the model, recently updated.

## Models Used

- **Faster R-CNN**: Used for object detection and feature extraction.
- **DETR (Detection Transformer)**: Implemented as a base model for the challenge.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the `train.py` script to train the model.
4. Use the `inference.ipynb` notebook to generate predictions.
5. Submit the predictions using `submission.csv`.

## Acknowledgements

- Zindi platform for organizing the challenge.
- ARM, UNICEF and MUST for sponsoring the competition.
